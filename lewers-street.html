      <h2>Lewers Street Managed Zone Pilot</h2>
      <p class="lede">Addressing unregulated loading and compliance challenges on one of Waikīkī's key corridors.</p>

      <!-- Large editable paragraph area -->
      <div class="lead-area">
        <p>Lewers Avenue faces significant challenges from unregulated loading and unloading activities. Between Don Ho Lane and Helumoa Road, posted regulatory signs prohibit parking with no exceptions, yet these signs are frequently disregarded by freight and passenger vehicles. As part of WTMA's comprehensive curb management initiative, Lewers Street was identified as a pilot area for testing new compliance strategies, advanced detection technology, and improved loading zone management.</p>

          <h4>Compliance Findings (2021)</h4>
          <p>Field observations along Lewers and adjacent corridors revealed critical challenges: only 6.5% of observed vehicles fully compliant with regulations; 77.9% lacked proper SID permits; safety hazards from illegally parked vehicles obstructing sight lines and forcing passengers into oncoming traffic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Safety Concerns</h4>
          <p>Vehicle drivers must monitor deliveries/passengers rather than oncoming traffic. Passengers are often unloaded directly into travel lanes or forced to cross in front of vehicles. This conflicts with the vision established when the Beachwalk development project was proposed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Actions & Technologies</h4>
          <p>Pilot includes special curb markings, regulatory sign improvements, advanced vehicle detection technology, permit/reservation systems, targeted enforcement, and compliance monitoring frameworks to establish equitable curb management practices.</p>
